| [next-release](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/next-release/SKILL.md) | Calculates next patch/minor/major release versions following Semantic Versioning. Used to determine version_added values for new features. |
| [pr-review](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/pr-review/SKILL.md) | Reviews pull requests and code changes in an Ansible collection against project standards and the Ansible Collection Review Checklist. Use when asked to review a PR, patch, diff, or set of code changes. Do not use for GitHub Issues or general Q&A. |
| [release](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/release/SKILL.md) | Guides the release of an Ansible collection following the upstream process (without release branches). Automatically determines the next version from changelog fragments. Outputs step-by-step instructions with commands for changelog generation, release PR, tagging, Galaxy publication, version bump, and GitHub release. Use when asked to release, publish, or tag a new collection version. |
| [remove-deprecations](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/remove-deprecations/SKILL.md) | Find and remediate overdue deprecation warnings in Ansible collection code. Identifies deprecated code past removal date/version and helps implement necessary changes. Use when preparing releases or cleaning up technical debt. |
| [run-tests](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/run-tests/SKILL.md) | Runs and writes tests (sanity, unit, integration) for an Ansible collection using ansible-test. Use when asked to run, check, or write tests for a module or utility. Do not use for PR reviews or questions unrelated to testing. |
| [sanity](ansible-collection-sdlc/module/skills/sanity/SKILL.md) | Run Ansible sanity tests with smart change detection. Use when testing Ansible collections, validating module code, running pre-commit checks, or preparing releases.
